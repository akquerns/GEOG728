```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This is what my first R markdown looks like

This is one paragraph.
It stretches over several consecutive lines,
but it will be formatted 
as a single paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
The blank line between the two
blocks of text tells Markdown
that they are separate paragraphs

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is _italic text_. This is *also italic text*. __This is boldface__ and 
**so is this**. ***This is bold italic***. This is
~~strikethrough~~, perhaps 
to indicate an error.

+hello

```{r codename, options}
print("hello") 
sigma <- 5.67E-8
I_solar <- 1350 # watts per square meter
albedo <- 0.3
I_absorbed <- I_solar * (1 - albedo)
T <- (I_absorbed / (4 * sigma))^0.25
T
```

We can use inline code to print the value of an R expression in the middle of a line of text. For example using inline code T =  `r T` will give T = 254.0663741. Or we could write T =  `r (I_absorbed / (4 * sigma))^0.25` to return 254.0663741.

T= `r T`
